# CallTimer
This is my Jaa Project for a call timer. Basically, if you take a lot of calls and want to track your average call time, calls per day, etc. Mostly built out of a need for me to track my own data, and also for some experience in Java development. Might port this over to HTML eventually, but for now it will be a Java project.
